# Data Processing 1 at WU
The Course Data Processing gave an introduction into Data Science in gaining fundamental knowledge for dealing with different data formats and in using methods and tools to integrate data from various sources in this course.
## Assignment 3
The Assigment dealt with:
* Inspecting dataset visually, as well as using proper Python instrumentation
* Tidying the dataset and describe the steps performed
* Apply a handling strategy for missing data (Python code) and discussing the consequences
* Deduplicating the data set (Python code) and describe the steps performed

## Project New York: Crime rates and law enforcement personnel
The project gives an overall overview over the safety of New York which can be a helpful for the local government in the process of decision-making e.g. allocation of resources for specific police departments/ counties.
By analyzing the law enforcement personnel in all counties of the state of New York from 2008 to 2018, we want to determine if a trend can be discovered and if so, in which direction does it go.
Another focus will be  the crime rates in relation to the development of the law enforcement personnel, if a correlation between them can be discovered. 

### Research Questions
* Did the size of the personnel in each county change in the last ten years and if so, by how much?
* Is there a correlation between crimes rates and number of police?
